;;; Commentary:
;; Most of these functions and ideas are either from Protesilaos Stavrou config
;; or made with him during his lessons.  A big thanks to Prot for helping me in
;; this wonderful journey to the depths of EmacsLisp.

;;; Code:


;; I want Emacs to write the list of bookmarks to the `bookmark-file'
;; as soon as I set a new bookmark.  The default behaviour of Emacs is
;; to write to the disk as a final step before closing Emacs.  Though
;; this can lead to data loss, such as in the case of a power failure.
;; Storing the data outright mitigates this problem.
(defun prot-bookmark-save-no-prompt (&rest _)
  "Run `bookmark-save' without prompt.

The intent of this function is to be added as an :after advice to
`bookmark-set-internal'.  Concretely, this means that when
`bookmark-set-internal' is called, this function is called right
afterwards.  We set this up because there is no hook after
setting a bookmark and we want to automatically save bookmarks at
that point."
